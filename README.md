### ♡ **Features**

### ♡ **Features**

- **Simple** Mode:
    - **2 colors** theme the entirety of iOS.
    - The colors have a 40% saturation influence by default.
    - The colors have a 20% lightness influence by default.
    - The alpha of the colors has no influence.
    - You can choose your own influences. For example, a saturation influence of 0 means that the color uses its original saturation while a saturation influence of 1 means that it uses the saturation of the original color. The lightness influence works the same way! You can also go in-between, and find the best influence for your colors!

- **Advanced** Mode:
    - You can choose every color manually.
    - The alpha of the color you choose does influence the real color.

- Allows you to **Export/Import** your colors!
  - Simply go to Flora's preferences and tap on the **Export** and **Import** buttons!

- Colors are themed inside **Apps**!
  - Enable Flora and watch as your colors magically change in all of your applications too, thanks to [libSandy](https://github.com/opa334/libSandy)
  - You can disable this from Flora's preference page in **Settings*!
